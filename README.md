# POTHOLE DETECTION USING YOLO MODELS

The Pothole Detection project uses state-of-the-art YOLO object detection models to automatically identify potholes in road images. The dataset was sourced from Roboflow Universe and kaggle, trained with YOLOv8s and YOLO11n models.The YOLOv8s model achieved slightly better performance with a higher mAP50-95 score, while YOLO11n provided faster and lighter inference.The project includes a well-structured dataset, a customizable data.yaml file, and an easy-to-run training pipeline. Images were resized to 800×800 and trained for 100 epochs to optimize accuracy. Training outputs such as loss curves, precision-recall plots, validation predictions, and confusion matrices were generated automatically.
